2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,730
This is an external
design system in practice.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,770
Hopefully you're in the right place.

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,310
If not, we can just take the chairs

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,845
that we put out and put them back.

6
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:13,095
(laughter)

7
00:00:14,532 --> 00:00:15,365
I am Brian Perry.

8
00:00:15,365 --> 00:00:18,470
I'm a lead front end
developer at Bounteous.

9
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,110
I live in the Chicago suburbs,

10
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,520
which is more relevant to say

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,980
when you are speaking at other camps.

12
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,785
Substantially less interesting here.```
